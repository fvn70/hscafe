## About
We know that you're planning to open a new place on the block. The place craves for a good website. Let's make it happen! The website will have multiple pages such as home, about, contact, and a navigation bar. Don't forget to make your website responsive so that users with various devices have no trouble accessing it. To make the interface stylish, we will use a front-end library called Bootstrap.
